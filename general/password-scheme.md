# Secure Password Scheme
* We will have a sheet with 40 randomly generated passwords.
	* Each password will be numbered, 1--40.
	* Each team member will be supplied a sheet with all passwords.
* Each service/OS/account will be assigned with a number, representing a password.
* There will be a universal salt and `!` which will prefix the password when it is used.
	* E.g.: If the password is, `random`, and the salt is `salt`, the password that will be entered on the computer is `salt!haha`.
